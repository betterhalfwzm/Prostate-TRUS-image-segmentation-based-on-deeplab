TRUS image segmentation of prostate based on deeplab V3+
This repo attempts to reproduce Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation (DeepLabv3+) in TensorFlow for semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC dataset. The implementation is largely based on my DeepLabv3 implementation, which was originally based on DrSleep's DeepLab v2 implemantation and tensorflow models Resnet implementation.
