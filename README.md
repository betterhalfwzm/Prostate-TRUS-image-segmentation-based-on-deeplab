# Prostate-TRUS-image-segmentation-based-on-deeplab
TRUS image segmentation of prostate based on deeplab V3+
This repo attempts to reproduce [Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation (DeepLabv3+)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611)
 The implementation is largely based on
 [rishizek DeepLabv3 implementation](https://github.com/rishizek/tensorflow-deeplab-v3-plus),
 which was originally based on
 [DrSleep's DeepLab v2 implemantation](https://github.com/DrSleep/tensorflow-deeplab-resnet)
 and [tensorflow models Resnet implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet).                          1.ori
